# Interaction 2 - Project 2

This site urges users to discover immigrant-owned restaurants in and around Ann Arbor. The site acts like a map, allowing the user to move around 4 quadrants as they zoom in closer to find these restaurants and the accompanying information. It also allows the user to zoom out and "ignore" these immigrant-owned restaurants, which has already been happening as these places are often overlooked. This is a response to restaurants in and around Ann Arbor that do not offer authentic food from the claimed regions as well as bringing awareness to small businesses.
